# GET PASSENGERS
### An Android app to allow collection and display of a list of airline passengers for a given flight.

#### Technical goals
1.  Develop an app  with two distinct activities -- a primary and secondary.
2.  Use of the register-for-results (**registerForActivityResutlt**) paradigm in the main activity to predefine callback behavior used to capture results data sent by the second activity.
3.  Use of the above mechanism to start the second activity.

#### Programming Language: 
Kotlin and XML
